we can transition into a society where everyone is not worried about survival by making the society ideal.

Modern ideal societies show a cultural, liberal growth as well. These societies put an increasing emphasis on equality and education for everyone as seen in the wide-reaching civil rights movements.

      some steps we have to take 


Investing in next generation

In the past 5 years, Peru has seen poverty rates decline drastically – from 50% in 2005 to 26% in 2012 – but, inequality in the country remains high and who your parents are, still is an deciding factor in which opportunities are available to you.

One important step towards realizing this goal is to invest in education. And this doesn’t stop at simply ensuring children go to school. There is also a real need to ensure that teachers are trained, have the equipment to teach and students are given the best environment.

“It’s not enough to send in a good teacher, if the children go to school hungry.” said Social Inclusion Minister Trivelli during the conversation.

Prior to the Town Hall, President Kim visited a rural school in Lamay in the province of Cuzco, where students have been given the best chance to learn, thanks to a school meals program, highly-trained teachers and sufficient learning materials. Responding to Minister Trivelli, he reiterated how important programs like these are and described the real sense of desire from parents to give their children a better chance in life than they did.

Natural resources

Much of Peru’s recent economic growth has derived from the extractive industries and the country’s many natural riches. As a result, many of those present at PUCP voiced concerns about the environmental and social effect.

Responding to these concerns, President Kim stated that, while these industries will be very important for Peru in the future, there are ways of both extracting the minerals and strongly benefitting both the local communities and the country as a whole. He did warn that for this to be achieved the country needs to avoid the natural resources curse – or, in other words, the overreliance on natural resources to the detriment of other enterprises.

Instead, he invited those present to think like his native South Korea. Poor in natural resources, the country has consistently innovated to form new industries, most recently investing in its culture, resulting in Psy’s global hit.

Fifteen years ago, President Kim came to Peru as a doctor to work with drug-resistant tuberculosis. Recalling his time in Carabayllo, he commented on the significant advances the country has made, not least in reducing poverty, improving education an increasing connectivity.

“There are still many problems,” Dr Kim concluded : but I have to say that on this trip, I see enormous optimism for the future.”
